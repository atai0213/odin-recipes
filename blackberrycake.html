    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4.5 cups fresh blackberries</li>
        <li>1.5 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, thinly sliced</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Sprinkle cake mix evenly over the berries. Place butter slices evenly over the cake mix; most of the cake mix should be covered with butter slices. Do not mix or stir.</li>
